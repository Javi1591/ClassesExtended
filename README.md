# ClassesExtended

A C++ console application project designed to extend class-based programming concepts. Built using Visual Studio (or another C++ development environment) as part of a classroom assignment, this project expands on basic class structures to incorporate inheritance, polymorphism, and enhanced object interactions.

---

## Project Overview

This project covers the following key concepts:

- Defining base classes and derived classes (inheritance).  
- Using virtual functions and polymorphism to allow dynamic behavior.  
- Overloading constructors and member functions for flexibility.  
- Aggregating and/or composing classes (objects within objects).  
- Managing collections of objects (e.g., array or vector of base-class pointers).  
- Input validation and formatted output for user-friendly interaction.  
- Clear separation of class interface (`.hpp`) and implementation (`.cpp`), along with meaningful comments.

---

## Features

- Prompt the user to select or create different types of objects (e.g., a base class type vs derived class).  
- Use polymorphism to handle derived-class objects via base-class pointers or references.  
- Allow user to input attributes for each object type (name, id, specialized attributes).  
- Process and display a list of objects with their specific behaviors (e.g., display details of a `Manager` vs `Employee`).  
- Validate user input (non-empty strings, valid numeric ranges).  
- Format console output neatly for readability (use of `iomanip`, tables, aligned columns).

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++ (compatible with C++11 or later)  
- IDE: Visual Studio 2019/2022 (or any C++ compiler environment)  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a system with a C++ compiler (Windows/Visual Studio preferred) and familiarity with basic C++ (classes, inheritance, polymorphism).

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Javi1591/ClassesExtended.git
cd ClassesExtended
